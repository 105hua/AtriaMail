# atriamail

***This version of AtriaMail is now considered "legacy", as I will be moving the project to an electron-vite and express-based solution.***

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run main.js
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.8. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
