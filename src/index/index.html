            Welcome to AtriaMail, a simple E-Mail Client that is focused around AI and built with Electron. 
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            E-Mail Management should not have to feel like a chore, that's why we have developed a simple
            yet effective application that aims to make this easier. The feature that sets us apart from
            other E-Mail solutions is our applications of Artificial Intelligence. Whether you are unsure
            on how to respond to an E-Mail or you are not sure whether an E-Mail may be spam or not, AtriaMail
            aims to assist you with that.
        </p>

            <strong>
                Please note that AtriaMail is under a heavy work-in-progress. There may be features missing,
                bugs and other issues and in it's current state, we do not recommend its use within important
                environments such as work or school. In addition to this, we also only support Google Mail at
                the moment, with plans to support other E-Mail providers in the future.
